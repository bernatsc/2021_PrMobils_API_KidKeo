hold up, hold up
I got a new girl and she's foreign
When the sun goes down, mami never get's boring
She coming with me when I'm touring
In every city we step, mami riding like she's from there
Like she's from there, she riding like she's from there
Like she foreign, she rides me different always
Like she's from there, she riding like she's from there
Like she foreign, she rides me different always
I got a new girl from The Bay (from The Bay)
She knows my name, but she love to call me bae, ay (call me bae)
She rides me dirty in L.A (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
But she's on her mami shit when we came back to Spain (mami mami)
Mi chica no es de por aquí
Ella es blanca como Europa, pussy como Medellín, llín
Estuvo de party por París
Y me lo estuvo dando todo cuando estabamos en Berlín
Hold on wait a minute (hold on, wait a second, what up? What?) oh
Maybe have you seen my girl around this spot? Ay
She was making business (she was right there, right there)
I don't know the fuck she doing, where the shooters at? Ay
You know baby all the money I'ma spend it all with you
Y todas esas que hatean en verdad quieren ser como tú
So baby, baby lemme get high, lemme flex on you
Estamos siempre, siempre haciendo money
Ya quisieran hacer tanto flushm, ay
I got a new girl and she's foreign
When the sun goes down, mami never get's boring
She coming with me when I'm touring
In every city we step, mami riding like she's from there
Like she's from there, she riding like she's from there
Like she foreign, she rides me different always
Like she's from there, she riding like she's from there
Like she foreign, she rides me different always
Told my baby pull up, that she pull up so hard (gotdamn)
Oh she's driving me crazy, and she ain't even have a car (skrrt skrrt)
I don't know why everybody want her even haters getting mad
But she loves me so good, she knows Keo getting guap
Estamos cashin', estamos cashin'
Estamos haciendo pila, manin' te lo juro
Y todo eso vale mierda si me paso una noche sin tu culo
Si tú eres mía, tú eres mía, sólo mia, mami yo eso te lo juro
Y sabes que como yo te lo hago por aquí no lo va a hacer ninguno
Alguien, I'm in clean money like a jeweler
Soon I'ma 'come a jeweler
Mami screaming Hallelujah
Now we got money spittin' like shooter
We are the party twistin', vaya lío
Citas sin sexy pussy like a río
'Tá tan caliente, siempre tiene frío
Quiere cariño, quiere estar conmigo
Staying in my lane, tell I be staying in my lane
And get money all different ways, she stay on the flame
My chica, she shoots from the flame
The pussy got all different tastes
She's like the queen, she's like the Promethazine
Every time I fuck her, I get high like it's Lean
I see you purple, I love the Codeine
I see you purple, that pussy Codeine
Got a new girl and she's foreign
When the sun goes down, mami never get's boring
She coming with me when I'm touring
In every city we step, mami riding like she's from there
Like she's from there, she riding like she's from there
Like she foreign, she rides me different always
Like she's from there, she riding like she's from there
Like she foreign, she rides me different always
